# Underscore Template Colorizer README

This is a simple extension of the Sublime underscore colorizer (itself a trivial extension of the html tmLanguage file) to provide some basic colorization to embedded js tags.  Currently this file targets `<?js>` format tags, following the pattern used in `jsDoc` templates.

## Features

In addition to the "usual" scope names, this grammar generates the following additional names for `.tmpl` files.

- `punctuation.definition.tag.html.embed.js` :  For the embedding js tags themselves.
- `punctuation.definition.string.begin.embedded`, `string.quoted.single.html.embedded`, `punctuation.definition.string.end.html.embedded` : For strings in an embedded js chunk.
- `punctuation.definition.tag.html.embedded.scope` : To colorize scope/control punctuation in an embedded js chunk.
- `punctuation.definition.tag.html.embedded` : All other embedded "punctuation" (e.g. operators, parens, etc.)
- `comment.line.double-slash.embedded.js`, `comment.block.embedded.js`, `comment.block.documentation.embedded.js` : Embedded comment body
    - `punctuation.whitespace.comment.leading.embedded.js` : leading white space for a comment
    - `punctuation.definition.comment.embedded.js` : The leading `//` for a comment
    - `storage.type.internaldeclaration.embedded.js` : @internal decl (honestly not familiar with this comment pattern)
    - `punctuation.decorator.internaldeclaration.embedded.js` : The `@internal` itself.
- `meta.embedded.js` : The entire body of embedded js chunks are tagged with this scope name.

## Usage

You can assign custom colors to the scope names generated by the grammar above by modifying your `Settings.json`.

    "editor.tokenColorCustomizations": {
      "textMateRules": [
        {
          "name": "Tags",
          "scope": [
              "punctuation.definition.tag.html.embed.js"
          ],
          "settings": {
              "foreground": "#666"
          }
        },

## Known Issues

- This grammar provides only limited coloring for embedded js.
- The scope names employed may be inappropriate.
- This grammar currently identifies `<?js>` as the embedded js tag.
- If you break up multi-line comments and interspace them with html, the colorizer will break
